dotfiles
========
My various dotfiles collected over the years from various places across the interweb.

###How to use###
Clone the repo and symlink the files/folders you want to use.

Example:

 ```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:Edholm/dotfiles.git  
$ cd dotfiles
$ ln -s zshrc ~/.zshrc
$ ln -s xinitrc ~/.xinitrc
$ ln -s i3 ~/.i3
# Etc.
```

####zsh####
If you want to use my zsh config. Clone my fork of oh-my-zsh first and place zshrc in `~/.zshrc` and the `eda.zsh-theme`
in `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom`
